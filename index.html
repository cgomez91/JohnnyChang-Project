<h2>
    WHY JOHNNY CHANG?
</h2>
<h3>Why Johnny is the best Gospel preacher?</h3>

<p class="test-part1">I was raised in religion. I was taught fear, rules, and that I had to earn God's love. But when I heard Johnny preach, everything changed. He didn't preach religion. He preached Jesus. He made the Gospel simple and clear - that salvation isn't about what we do, but about what Christ has already done. </p>

</div>

<div class="text-bottom">
<p>He teaches the bible with humility and boldness, always pointing to Jesus. He relates deeply to those the world - and religion- often overlook because he walks the same path: redeemed and grounded in truth. Through his online minisitry, Core of The Heart, I found what I didn't have before - real teaching, real fellowship, and a real connection to the truth of God's Word. A literal lifeline for so many who are apart of the community, spiritually hungry for hope and truth. 
Johnny always stays true to the Word, he's studied through his preaching, lives are being changed and souls are being saved. It's been a blesing to be apart of it all, I'm truly thankful for everything him and his team does for the community.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Corina Gomez and I'm currently studying front-end development. I'm very passionate in learning about the Gospel and I love hearing it explained and taught by Minister Johnny Chang. He is truly amazing at what he does, I believe he will be the world's best Gospel Preacher of our time. I created this page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding skills.
